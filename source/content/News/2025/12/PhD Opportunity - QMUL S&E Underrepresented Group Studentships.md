**About the PhD position**

A position for UK/Home eligible students from [Underrepresented Groups](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/scholarships/items/uk-bame-phd-studentships-1.html) is available on the topic of “Collaborative Motion‑Based Hybrid Live Coding”. 

We are seeking prospective PhD applicants for a project on human–human and human–robot live coding performance and musical co‑creation via haptic communication. The research will investigate how a robot or a another human can perceive musical intent of a partner, generate its own "code" in real time, and perform in a shared creative environment. We are especially interested to see how this can be realised through motion features and haptic input.

**Co-supervisors**: Dr Ekaterina Ivanova & Dr Anna Xambó Sedó

**Keywords**: live coding, human-robot interaction, haptic input

**Application Deadline**

* Application deadline: **28th January 2026**
